            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Ask Binny is a recycling website that was created as part of an
              annual collaborative project between TAMK and Munich University.
              The website was produced in the fall of 2023 with the goal of
              producing a software product for a given client company.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our project team's client was TAMK's waste management department.
              Our team consisted of four software development students from TAMK
              and seven business students from Munich. I worked as a frontend
              developer alongside another student. Additionally, I was
              responsible for UX/UI design. The Ask Binny frontend was
              implemented using React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS. Its backend was
              implemented using MySQL and Node.js. It is currently running on
              AWS.
              <br />
              <br />
              In this case study, I will mainly focus on my involvement with the
              project. However, since I worked on this project with others, I
              will also cover some important topics regarding the project as a
              whole.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            In the beginning, we needed to determine what type of product we
            would be developing. We had to get to know our client and their
            requirements for the product. The programming team had to decide
            which language and tools would be best suited for the product.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our client had their recycling information webpage, which was only
            accessible by logging in with our school's login credentials.
            Moreover, the webpage was a lengthy block of text that was unlikely
            to engage a lot of people. After implementing our own customer
            survey, we found out that none of the students were aware of the
            webpage, despite our client's belief to the contrary.
            <br />
            <br />
            Upon meeting with our client, we identified some key issues that
            needed to be addressed:
          </p>
          <li>How can we encourage students to recycle more? </li>
          <li>How can we identify the reasons for the low recycling rates? </li>
          <li>
            How can we make the product easily accessible and informative to
            users?
          </li>
          <p>
            Our client's main objective was to create a product that would
            encourage recycling on campus.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <h3>Project Working</h3>
          <p>
            Our project started with a kick-off, where we did an empathy map and
            prepared questions for our client meetings. We started working
            backwards to figure who are our client and customers, and what is
            our problem. Because our we needed more information about our
            client’s customers, I contributed a Forms based customer research
            with another team member. We defined some base questions for the
            survey and processed the data we received. Our team also did a crazy
            eight, to figure out our big idea. And we also did a storyboard to
            represent the customer problem and the benefit. I wrote an FAQ about
            the most likely user questions. Our client told us, that one of
            their goals is to meet the EcoCompass criteria. I studied the
            EcoCompass criteria and taught our team about it. From this base, we
            started to contribute our final product.
            <br />
            <br />
            We had meetings every other day with the whole team, and in every
            sprint with the client. I partitioned and scheduled the front end
            developers product backlog items. I was also in charge of explaining
            the development process to the business side of the team. And I was
            the contact person between our team and the Finnish teachers.
            <br />
            <br />
            At the end of the project I participated in our project technical
            and final documentation. I wrote about our products informational
            architecture, code structure, product maintenance and installation,
            and system modification to our technical documentation. For our
            final documentation I wrote about our project overview, end
            products, workload, schedules, and customer satisfaction.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subHeadline">Frontend Development</h3>
          <p>
            As a team of front-end developers, we collectively decided to use
            JavaScript and React for our website. Our decision was based on our
            desire to create an interactive website that could be further
            developed in the future. Additionally, we were already familiar with
            JavaScript and React from our prior studies. During development, we
            used GitHub Pages for testing purposes since we didn't have access
            to AWS at the time.
            <br />
            <br />

            My responsibilities were to build the foundation for each page using
            HTML and CSS. After that, I used JavaScript and React to connect the
            database created by our back-end developers to the front-end we had
            designed. I fetched all the pictures, texts, and maps related to the
            waste types for the front-end to display. On the Front Page, I added
            a sorting button as our initial idea of a search bar was dismissed.
            Additionally, I made the website responsive so that it can scale for
            computers and mobile phones. This involved making some user
            interface changes, such as modifying the navigation system. Lastly,
            I made sure to take care of the usability and user interfaces. I
            achieved this by creating pop-ups and using CSS to provide users
            with more highlighted feedback about their actions.

              <h3>Usability and User Interface Design</h3>
              <p>
                I was responsible for creating a Figma prototype for our
                project. Initially, I created a prototype for mobile and once
                our team was satisfied with the structure and features, I also
                designed a desktop version. I will share more details about the
                design project later in this case study.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our goal was to align the visual appearance with the Tampere
                Universities brand and add an interesting Ask Binny mascot. I
                created a color palette and drew the Binny mascot to achieve
                this.

            After identifying the main features of our website, I began creating
            some wireframe examples. We ultimately decided on a plan that
            includes four key views: the Front Page, a Waste Type Page, a Waste
            Map Page, and an Info Page. On the Front Page, we made it a priority
            to present the user with the main feature right away - the option to
            select the type of waste they are searching for. Once a
            user selects a waste type, they are taken to the Waste
            Type page where they will receive information about that particular
            waste. From there, they can proceed to the Waste Map page, where
            they will be presented with a map displaying the locations of waste
            bins on campus. Additionally, we decided to include an Info page
            where users can access FAQs and other important information about
            the website.

            more freely. For instance, if a user does not want to select a waste

              <h3>The First Prototype</h3>
              <p>
                We have two front page prototypes featuring a mockup mascot,
                Binny the Bin. The first prototype was the one we chose to use.
                In addition for the waste images, it includes a map button that
                is visible at all times. However, both prototypes were designed
                with the possibility of adding more waste types in the future.
                <br />
                <br />
                The second prototype on the left was dismissed due to its use of
                dropdowns, which didn't optimize the available space
                effectively. We believe that images of the waste types would be
                more efficient than a dropdown with numerous options.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our goal was to make everything accessible to the user on the
                front page, considering that this website is designed primarily
                for mobile use but should also be functional on laptops and
                desktops. As a result, we had to consider how we used the
                available space.

                I have a couple examples of the color schemes I was testing for
                the prototype. Please note that the waste images used in these
                pictures are only placeholders for visualization purposes. In
                this prototype, I have included a search icon for the waste
                types. This way, users can choose from many options or search to
                find their waste faster.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have also made a few changes to balance the visuals. I moved
                the mascot from the way to the logo at the top and moved the
                hamburger menu to the left. Additionally, I removed the map
                button from the first view, as users will be directed there
                after choosing a waste or navigating through the menu.

              <h3>The Mascot Prototype</h3>
              <p>
                I sketched some prototypes of Binny the Bin for our team. After
                due consideration, we decided to use the one in the middle, but
                with the eyes from the one on the left. Our team collectively
                agreed to keep the hands on Binny since it made the character
                more expressive and versatile.

          <p>
            I conducted usability testing for a website with multiple users
            using their mobile devices. The users were asked to perform basic
            interactions on the website.
            <br />
            <br />
            During the testing, I discovered three major issues:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Some text on Apple devices appeared in blue color.</li>
            <li>
              There were responsiveness issues with the hamburger menu and some
              of the images were not displaying properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              The sorting button was not labeled properly, causing confusion
              among the users.

              <h3>Testing During Development</h3>
              <p>
                Our team initially planned to showcase Binny the Bin on the
                front page of our website. The original plan was to have Binny
                occupy the entire screen upon opening the website. The
                background was intended to be dimmed, and Binny would disappear
                upon clicking. The reason for this was to have a text tutorial
                at the beginning. However, we later decided to abandon this idea
                as it would have resulted in unnecessary waiting and clicking
                for the users. In my opinion, good usability should be intuitive
                even without text instructions.
                <br />
                <br />

                Another idea our team had was to keep the footer visible at all
                times, even when the page had scrollable content. This concept
                is also visible in the attached picture. However, after testing
                our Figma prototype and the actual website with these features,
                we decided to discard these plans. As the main designer of the
                project, I was happy about this decision because it would have
                taken unnecessary space from the actual content.

            <h3>Mobile View</h3>
            <p>
              In order, the three mobile pages are: The Front Page, the Waste
              Type Page, and the Map Page. All the pages have the same header
              and navigation bar. We decided to reduce the number of waste types
              on our website, so I replaced the search button with a sorting
              button. The waste types we used were based on the results of our
              own user survey. These waste types caused the most puzzlement
              among the students and the staff.
              <br />
              <br />
              I was responsible for implementing the sorting button and fetching
              the images for each page from the backend to the frontend. I also
              created all the pages in HTML and CSS. The last image shows some
              of the usability features I added, such as highlighting the
              current floor and waste type to help the user navigate the site.
              By default, the website displays the first floor along with every
              waste type.

            <h2>What I Learned?</h2>
            <p>
              Throughout this project, I gained a great deal of experience
              working remotely. Our project team consisted of members from
              different countries and we had to rely solely on virtual meetings.
              This helped me understand the importance of organizing my work
              schedule and keeping track of my work hours. I also learned how to
              better estimate the time required to complete various tasks.
              Working in a multicultural team gave me the opportunity to improve
              my English language skills.
              <br />
              <br />
              In terms of development, I enhanced my knowledge regarding
              connecting front-end and back-end systems using JavaScript and
              React. I gained a better understanding of CSS and its
              complexities, especially in relation to responsiveness and
              layouts. I also realized the significance of good design planning,
              which ultimately saves a significant amount of time during the
              coding process.
