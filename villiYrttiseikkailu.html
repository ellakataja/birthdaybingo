            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Villi yrttiseikkailu is an Android mobile game available on the
              Play Store. The game was produced in spring 2022. It is a part of
              the annual Game Project of Business Information Systems first-year
              studies. In 2022 the Game Project was a part of the VIRMA (Virtual
              tourism) -project. The goal was to produce a mobile game for a
              local business. 
              <br />
              <br />
              Our project team’s client was a Tampere-based experience and
              activity service business Villipihlaja Tmi. Villipihlaja offers a
              range of services, including guided forest experiences, private
              cruises, and wild herb courses. The game is based on
              Villipihlaja’s Wild Vegetable online courses and was developed
              using Unity with C# language and 2D graphics. 
              <br />
              <br />
              Our project team consisted of four students, including two coders
              and two graphic designers. As the scrum master and one of the
              graphic designers, my responsibilities included documentation and
              communication, gameplay planning, designing usability, and
              creating graphics. Although programming wasn't initially part of
              my role, I also studied C# during the project.
              <br />
              <br />
              Overall, the project was a great learning experience for us,
              and we're proud of the final product we delivered.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Initially, we had to determine what kind of game we were going to
            create. For this reason, we had to understand our client's
            requirements and expectations for the product. Using Unity and C#
            programming language was a new experience for all of us. As a scrum
            master, I coordinated meetings with our client throughout the
            project.
            <br />
            After our first meeting with the client, we identified some primary
            challenges that we needed to address:
          </p>
          <li>How can we make the game both educational and entertaining?</li>
          <li>How can we make the game addictive?</li>
          <li>How can we ensure that the educational content is accurate?</li>
          <li>
            How can we create a fresh look and feel that reflects the beauty of
            Finnish nature?
          </li>
          <p>
            The primary goal of our client was to develop a game that motivates
            people to learn about nature and enjoy its serene environment.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <h3>Scrum Master's View</h3>
          <p>
            As a project team, we tackled the first two problems: How to make an
            educational game, which is also entertaining and addicting?
            Initially, we created five different game concepts and then narrowed
            them down to the best three. We produced simplistic prototypes for
            these three ideas. We then conducted a Forms survey, where we
            introduced these prototypes to potential users
            and collected feedback. The prototypes and feedback were
            presented to our client, who assisted us in selecting the primary
            game concept.
            <br />
            <br />
            We decided to create an adventure game that takes place in Finnish
            nature, where the player collects wild herbs. To add an educational
            aspect to the game, we included a plant book with all the
            information about wild herbs. By reading about the herbs and
            learning from their actions in the game, the user can learn about
            the herbs. We wanted to make the game entertaining for everyone, so
            we let the users decide how much they want to "study" in the game.
            To make the game addictive, we added scoring and a time limit. We
            also made sure that the wild herbs grow in different places each
            time you play the game. Additionally, the animals in the game will
            say different things every time you interact with them, which adds
            to the variability of the game. These features are important for
            making the game enjoyable and engaging.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once our game concept was completed, I was responsible for
            writing the final game plan with our group as the scrum master. To
            ensure that our project documentation was of high quality, I used
            SMART criteria to help define our product backlog and sprint
            schedules. Additionally, I created a RACI model with our team to
            ensure that everyone was aware of their responsibilities. As part of
            the risk management process, we conducted a risk analysis, where we
            identified all the possible risks we might face and assessed their
            potential impact on the project. I updated our risk analysis after
            every sprint and also wrote our new schedules with sprint backlogs
            while keeping our project documentation up-to-date. To stay on
            track, I arranged daily meetings with our team and roughly one
            meeting per sprint with our client.

              <h4>Learning The Wild Herbs</h4>
              <p>
                We ensured that the educational content was accurate through
                collaboration with our client. I studied their wild herb courses
                online and identified 21 plants for use in the game. I collected
                and wrote information about these herbs, which our client
                reviewed and accepted.
                <br />
                <br />
                I also drew accurate wild herbs based on our client's images. It
                was important that the drawings were recognizable and fit the
                playful and colorful look of the game.

              <h4>Character Development</h4>
              <p>
                As part of our efforts to create an engaging and exciting game,
                I wanted to give our characters a unique personality. To achieve
                this, we created three playable characters, each representing a
                mystical aspect of Finnish nature. These characters were
                designed to provide players with greater depth in the game.
                Additionally, we incorporated animals from Finnish nature into
                the game as guides for players. 
                <br />
                <br />
                These characters and animals were illustrated by our other
                graphic designer. But to make them more lively, I animated them
                using Unity. Additionally, I wrote individual speeches for each
                animal, ranging from tips about the game to facts about wild
                herbs, and even some funny puns.

              <h4>The Look and Feel</h4>
              <p>
                To create a finished look and feel of Finnish nature, I added
                some nature sounds in the background, such as birds singing and
                bees flying around. In addition, I added some UX sounds, such as
                clicking sounds when the user is pressing some of the menu
                icons, ticking clock when the time is running out, and paper
                sounds when the plant book is being opened.
                <br />
                <br />
                I also wanted a finished UI look for the buttons I created. All
                possible buttons are made with as little text as possible, but
                so that they are still understandable.

              <h4>Creating Finnish Environment</h4>
              <p>
                Once I gained knowledge about the various locations where wild
                herbs grow, I proceeded to create a map for our game. I drew all
                the levels along with their objects and decorations. To give it
                a fresh and authentic look, I selected some traditional Finnish
                objects and plants for the environment.
                <br />
                <br />
                I also created all the other essential views for the game, such
                as the main menu, the plant book, and the instructions.
                Everything in the game is drawn using the same color palette
                that I developed. By connecting these elements with Finnish wild
                herbs, animals, and sounds, we have created the perfect Finnish
                environment.

          <p>
            This is a map I did that depicts the architecture of the
            application. There are eight different views in the game. When the
            application is launched, the user is directed to the Main Menu. From
            there, they can choose to start a new game, read instructions, check
            information about the game, or exit the application.
            <br />
            <br />
            If the user decides to start a new game, they will be able to select
            their character. During the game, the user can access the plant
            book, which allows them to open a specific plant and read about it.
            They can also return to the Main Menu and access the same options as
            before. The user can resume the game from there.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once the timer runs out, the game ends, and the player is shown an
            end screen. From that screen, the user can view their points, learn
            more about the wild herbs, and return to the Main Menu.

              <h3>The First Prototype</h3>
              <p>
                We created the first prototype of the game view which showcases
                the layout we have been working on. Our main objective was to
                make the joystick button (for moving the character) easily
                accessible, so we placed it on the bottom left. Similarly, we
                placed the collect action (the basket) on the bottom right.
                These two buttons are the primary actions required to play the
                game. Therefore, we made sure they were big enough to use
                effortlessly. On the top left, we decided to show the remaining
                time and the points gathered. On the top right, we placed the
                plant book.
                <br />
                <br />
                In this prototype, you can also see some of the initial versions
                of the wild herbs and the first playable character. To represent
                the book and the joystick button, we used placeholders, which we
                took inspiration from for the final versions.

              <h3>The Second Prototype</h3>
              <p>
                In our playtests, we used the second prototype of our game. I
                made some changes to this version, including replacing the
                buttons with my own drawings and adding a final base to the
                level which I drew in Unity. I also added some decorative
                elements, like lamps, bushes, and benches. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Furthermore, I added a home button to the game, which was
                initially located on the left side and had a different
                appearance than the other buttons. The points and time are still
                displayed without any background.

              <p>
                I also designed the plant book, which served as a background for
                some of our views in the game. Unfortunately, the plant book
                prototype was too small to accommodate all the content we wanted
                to include. Additionally, it had some usability issues, such as
                the X-button being the same color as the pages.
                <br />
                <br />
                The wild herb prototype, which was featured in the book, was
                intended to be edible Goutweed. However, during a meeting with
                our client, I discovered that it could be easily mistaken for
                the extremely poisonous Cowbane. I suggested changing the
                drawing, but after discussing the matter with our client, they
                decided to keep it as is and rename it to Cowbane.

          <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
          <p>
            Our team conducted a playtest with four different users. We planned
            three relevant tasks that each test user had to complete. We also
            created research questions for ourselves to keep track of.
            Additionally, we wrote questions for the users to answer after the
            testing ended. One of our team members took notes during the testing
            process while I led the testing situation. I also interviewed the
            test users after they had tried the game. During the test, we
            refrained from giving any instructions to the testers or answering
            any of their questions.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a result of the testing, we identified three main issues:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The plant book did not provide enough clear information about
              the bad plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              The users didn't receive sufficient feedback after they picked up
              wild herbs.
            </li>

              <h4>A Warning Button</h4>
              <p>
                After testing, I added two new icons to the plant book.
                <br />
                The first icon is a red warning button which, when clicked,
                opens a text box that informs the user that collecting the plant
                will result in the loss of points. It is worth noting that these
                plants are not meant to be used in real life either.

                usage restrictions of a wild herb in real life. When the user
                clicks on this button, a text box appears with details regarding
                the specific restrictions of the herb. These plants may be used
                in real life but with certain restrictions. The player will get
                points after collecting them.

                To improve navigation, I added paths leading to the connection
                points. These paths are designed to help you easily move around
                the area without getting lost. Secondly, I created signposts in
                strategic locations to provide clear directions and information
                on which areas are where. With these changes, I believe that
                the overall navigation experience will be much smoother and more
                efficient for everyone.

                The final version of the game contains all the features from the
                initial prototype and some newly added ones. I created a new
                Home Menu button and placed it beside the plant book button.
                Additionally, I ensured that all the user interface buttons have
                consistent style and background to enhance their visibility. I
                also changed the joystick button to have a more universal
                appearance. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Furthermore, I used the same color palette for all graphics. The
                plants now spawn randomly throughout the levels, providing a
                unique gaming experience every time. Additionally, the animals

                selected fonts that complement our handmade and natural style.
                It was crucial to choose a readable font and keep our

            <h2>What I Learned?</h2>
            <p>
              Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in working
              on an agile project. I honed my communication skills by
              effectively engaging with both the client and the project team.
              Additionally, I learned how to organize and lead meetings, as well
              as create and deliver presentations. I also developed the ability
              to schedule and prioritize a project’s backlog, and produce
              essential project documentation.
              <br />
              Moreover, I acquired new skills in creating and animating 2D
              graphics using Unity, Adobe Photoshop, and Gimp. I also got to
              know the fundamentals of the C# language and gained insights into
              mobile UI/UX design.
