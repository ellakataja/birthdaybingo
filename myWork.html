        <h3>Villi yrttiseikkailu</h3>
        <p>
          First year studies mobile game project, which was done for a client.
          My main roles were a scrummaster and a graphic designer. I took the
          main responsibility of the communication with the client and between
          the team. I also managed the schedules and product backlog of the
          project. On the graphic side, I designed and drew all the plants,
          scenery, items, menu icons and buttons. The graphics are made using
          Gimp as 2D graphics and we animated them in Unity. The game is
          programmed in C# and published on Google Play. Our project team's game
          won 2022 year annual vote as the best game of the course.

        <h3>Ask Binny</h3>
        <p>
          Third year studies collaboration project with München university. We
          made a recycling website for TAMK's waste management with München
          business students. I worked as a frontend developer and an UI/UX
          designer. The website is done using JavaScript, React and Node.js. The
          design is made using Figma. I got excellent grades from the project.
